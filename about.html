            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              MechLab Precision LLP was founded to close the gap between design intent and
              manufacturing reality. Our team blends practical machining knowledge with
              disciplined process planning to produce high-integrity components.
            </p>
            <p>
              We collaborate with product teams from concept validation through scaled
              production, focusing on manufacturability, consistency, and lead-time
              efficiency.
